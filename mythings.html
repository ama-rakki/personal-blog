        <h2>my coolest items</h2>
        <p>life is a collection of things... in the broadest sense! superficially, I really hate consumerism. I don’t
          like the feeling of spending so much money on food (that will just vanish) and housing (when such a basic
          human need is so expensive). I really envy the basic country lifestyle. I would love to live off the food I
          grow in a garden and not have to pay a mortgage for a simple country cottage. But even that life is difficult
          (of course it is! All lives can be difficult). </p>
        <p>Anyways what I’m trying to say is that while I feel its ridiculous to spend so much money on such basic
          living requirements, I also think it ridiculously fun to spend money on things I like. Owning things I like is
          probably the reason why capitalism works so well. We like things so we want things! This is definitely the
          most basic explanation of it you can get. </p>
        <p>I want the things I own to be a reflection of me; my interests, my values, my hobbies, my aesthetics, and how
          I hope to be perceived. This is why I’m sharing some of my favorite items with you today, because hopefully
          they will allow you to perceive me a little better. All of these items are found around my small room. My room
          is really just a treasure chest of me! All of my treasures in one box (my room plus a bed). </p>

        <h2>Yotsuba&!: complete manga collection</h2>
        <img src="images/mangacollection.jpg">
        <p><i>Yotsuba&!</i> By Kiyohiko Azuma is my favorite manga series for its simplicity, art style, premise, characters, and relax nature. I highly recommend reading it! Azuma’s other series <i>City</i> is good as well! </p>

        <h2>Blind boxes</h2>
        <img src="images/blindboxes.jpg">
        <p>Whenever my boyfriend and I go to the city we like to splurge on blind boxes. We have a pretty big collection now, I like to think of it as a collection that really grow really big over time!! It signifies all the fun we have together overtime, so I really cherish them. Its also really fun just to open the box not knowing what might be inside. I bit like gambling XD :o! </p>
