        <p>It is already my third east coast winter and this one has definitely been the strongest! Something must
          have
          happened with miss global warming because my college town has already experienced three big snow falls,
          todays
          being the biggest. </p>
        <p>I was lovingly awoken at 4 am by the police using their megaphone to announce all cars on our street would
          be
          towed if not moved (I guess they really wanted to start plowing early?). But it feels like we got a good
          foot
          of snow this time, definitely enough to fall into my boots at least.</p>
        <p>Although I’m a west coaster at heart I think I’ve acclimated pretty well to the winters here. My only
          concern
          is that Punxsutawney Phil (the groundhog on duty for groundhogs’ day) had predicted an early spring! And
          right
          before the snowstorm we had a deceivingly warm weekend! </p>
        <p>Again, I know miss global warming is behind this, but I guess she can’t help it (it’s not her fault its
          ours!) </p>
        <p>Anyways I really just wanted to share some pictures I took on our (me and my boyfriends) walk to the gym.
