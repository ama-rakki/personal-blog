          <p>For pretty much all of my conscious life I have been learning. In the US, kids are put into school at 5 years old, and its round a 16 years journey to earn a college bachelor’s degree (which is what I’m currently doing) so needless to say I have been in classrooms for most days of the year for 14 years. Along this time, I started a journey with note taking, I started to enjoy the act of writing, highlighting, drawing, and decorating pages of notes in middle school. </p>
          <p>From the American consumerist pov I guess I really just enjoyed the action of buying something and using it everyday (the same goes for art supplies). Some of my favorite things to buy were <a href="https://www.muji.us/collections/pen-pencils">Muji pens</a> and <a href="https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/discover-mildliner">Mildliner Highlighters</a> (and in recent years it has been washi tape). When I just started committing to spending more time beautifying my notes, I realized that practically all of the products I like were made in Japan. Or was it because they were from Japan that I liked them? That can be a whole separate essay on its own!</p>
          <p>When I started taking Computer Science classes for my college major, I pretty much knew that the content was virtually impossible document with handwritten notes. I found it mush more efficient to use software like Notion with a built-in code previewer. However, I am still pursuing a Biology minor, and these classes give me a better opportunity to use my hoard of stationary supplies. </p>
          <p>Using notes as a medium of art can feel easier to me compared to making an original painting for example. Something completely new like that is significantly more personal and creative, and while I wish I could master that too, for the time being I like to put more energy into something simpler but equally as authentic. </p>
          <p>Often times I find I spend too much time making my notes look nice, ultimately taking away time from actually studying and retaining the material! This isn’t the best feeling, but I think as long as I’m away of my prioritize I can allow myself to spend some time (and money) on making notes nice. </p>
