        <h2>why I read</h2>
        <p>I like to read to train my eyes. Everyday I feel like my pupils are becoming weaker. I guess I also like to train my brain too.</p>
        <p>But more than that, I like to collect things. And every book I finish I see as an opportunity to buy a copy of and add to my collection. </p>
        <p>I like to read new books on my kindle first, then if I like it a lot, I consider buying a physical copy to refer to, lend, and reread. </p>

        <h2>Currently reading:</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;"><i>The Creative Act: A Way of Being</i></h3>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 45px;">By: Rick Rubin</h4>
        <p>Good so far. I am trying to line up my own creative habits with the ones he recommends, but then again not every creative schedule works for everyone! So I am trying to consider which ones would work best for me, and which might be a hindrance to my own creative process.</p>
        <p>I would recommend reading if you are trying to pursue a hobby but donâ€™t know how to stick to it.</p>
